# support-firecloud [![TravisCI Status][2]][1] [![CircleCI Status][4]][3] [![Github Actions CI Status][6]][5]

Software and configuration that support TobiiPro's Cloud Services development.


**IMPORTANT:** Almost all github.com/tobiipro repositories have `support-firecloud` as a git submodule.  
It is therefore **important that you clone these repositories recursively**, otherwise `make` **will** fail.
* use `git clone --recursive ...`
* or run `git submodule update --init --recursive` after cloning.
